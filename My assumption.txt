In this model, we divide the signals into two sets: North-South and East-West,
for easy execution and simplicity. Therefore we assume that same signal
persists for both the directions in each set. For instance if North has RED then
implicitly South also has RED. Likewise the same applies for East-West.
2. The sensors is a boolean variable: only takes TRUE or FALSE. For simplicity
we make North-South direction sensors as one sensor: ns_sensor and EastWest direction sensors as ew_sensor.3. We also assume that the duration for red and green is 10 seconds while the
duration for yellow is 3 seconds.
4. The variables ns_ped_light and ew_ped_light only takes anyone of the
values: {WAIT, WALK}
5. The emergency vehicles does not come from both the directions at the same
time. Only one emergency sensor might be TRUE at any given time.
