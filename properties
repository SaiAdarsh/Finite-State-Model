The following are the safety properties.
(i) SPEC AG (ns_ped_light = WALK -> ns_signal != GREEN)
The pedestrian light cannot indicate that I should walk when the traffic light is
green.This is a safety property as we are saying that something should NEVER
happen.
(ii) SPEC AG !(ns_signal = GREEN & ew_signal = GREEN)
Both NS and WS signal lights cannot be true at GREEN at same time.
(iii) SPEC AG (ns_ped_light = WALK -> ns_signal != YELLOW)
The pedestrian light cannot indicate that I should walk when the traffic light is
yellow.This is a safety property as we are saying that something should NEVER
happen.
The following are the liveness properties.
(i) LTLSPEC G (ns_signal = RED & ns_button = RESET -> F (ns_signal = GREEN))
○ If theNS signal light is red, and the button is reset, then eventually, the NS signal
light will turn green.
○ This is a liveness property, as we assert that something will eventually happen.
(ii) SPEC AF ((ew_signal = RED & ew_button = SET) -> AF ew_ped_light = WALK)
If the EW signal light is red and the pedestrian button is SET, then eventually the EW
pedestrian signal light changes to WALK.
(iii) SPEC AF (ew_ped_light = WALK -> ew_ped_light = WAIT)
If the EW pedestrian signal is WALK eventually it changes to WAIT.
